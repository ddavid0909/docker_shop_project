When running the app main_app, you can test all functionalities from main_app_testing jupyter notebook before running
commands:
1. docker ps
then finding the name of the container for main_app and running
2. docker exec -it <container_name> bash
then running
3. flask --app main_app.py db upgrade
for migrations to occur.
This was done on purpose to simulate the work with migrations. Only after having migrated the changes to the database
should you run ethereum_testing.ipynb.
Getters from sol file where added for testing purposes and will be removed soon.
